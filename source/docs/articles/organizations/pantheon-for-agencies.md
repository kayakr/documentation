Scale your agency. Pantheon for Agencies (P4A) gives you the power to manage all of your sites, people, and support tickets in one place.

## Create Your Agency Profile
Log in to your Pantheon account dashboard and navigate to [https://dashboard.pantheon.io/organizations](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/organizations). We ask for evidence that you have developed a few websites and have your own presence on the web. When you’re a full partner, we’ll run that site on a Professional plan, for free.
