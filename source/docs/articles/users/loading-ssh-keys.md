To take full advantage of Pantheon, you should load your public SSH key into your account. SSH keys are a best-practice for authentication, allowing you more security than a simple password. You will only need to do this once, no matter how many sites you work on.

### Copy Your Public Key
Load the public portion of your key. Typically, this is the file ending in `.pub`. The text of a public key contains three components: the type, the key, and the comment. For instance:

<textarea cols="80" readonly rows='8"' style="font-family: monospace">ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAuDVDG43S7yt/lG+CkFA462VCAYk3/h6B01x3QMFl4OGC0zppp4MDkQ5Li3rka3qWLmDbMFJyDBvb+ST+6ncJmzqcm7sEkWFqu6iLUhzzldKasRe3QARAE4Jn0zjqBucfqG86tA0UMxvR0dYFjGBHJmdHxiNe9i3+xFF1t1nvnyMaYWblC/OllWO7tZhrVTQRonKsIcCdw0fxFVUpjAYffX8Jha6azoJt6MOWVwWQWKFqZzUH94hp2tO9VmTS5wAq8PxnTMYVQT4YC1NiTHjEnrEFDcmZCmQn/taJxLwpomtbWIme17sPryIDa0t/0DR1MKHNzZraor98eyNfCEFGfw== joshk@mithras</textarea>

In the above example the key type is "ssh-rsa", though you may also generate ssh-dsa or ssh-dss keys depending on your local settings. The long character string is the key, and the `user@machine` at the end is the comment, which is helpful in identifying where a key came from and who it is for.

### Add Your Key

1. Log in to Pantheon and visit the Account page.
2. Click **SSH Keys**, and paste the copied key into the box.
3. Click **Add Key**.

Once the key has been successfully added, it will appear under the list of available keys on your Pantheon Account page.

### Delete a Key
To delete a key, go to the Account page and click **SSH Keys**. Simply click the **Remove** button next to the key you want to delete.

If you have no keys remaining but still have active sites, you will still have access to them and can make edits via SFTP using your account password to authenticate. However, there will be no Git access as you need a valid key uploaded to your account.
